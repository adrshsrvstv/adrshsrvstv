Hi there! I'm an software engineer based in India, currently getting my feet wet in machine learning. You can know more about me on my [linkedin](http://linkedin.com/in/adrshsrvstv/) or blog/portfolio [here](adrshsrvstv.com). I love talking to people and looking at all the cool things they are building, so feel free to reach out to me here, on linkedin, or the good old mail at adarsh0112@gmail.com !

Cheers! 🍻
